# Micro-frontends: Module Federation with WebPack 5

## What is Module Federation?

It is basically a JavaScript architecture. It allows a JavaScript application to dynamically load code from another application (a different Webpack build).

Here we load a `Counter` component from `app2` to `app1`, `CounterState` component from `app3` to `app1` and we catch the error when the module is not found.
